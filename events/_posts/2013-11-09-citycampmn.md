CityCampMN is our region's 2nd installment of the [wildly popular global
unconference series](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/) connecting civic doers,
makers and hackers together with local and state government officials and civic
leaders for a day of learning, discussing, imagining and building.

Come hack your community. You are the change you've been waiting for. Help
create the city you want to live in.

CityCampMN 2013 is Saturday, November 9th at Schulze Hall on the University of
St. Thomas' Minneapolis campus. The event runs from 9 to 4, with an exciting
reception with E-Democracy's BeNeighbors.org project afterwards from 4 to 6.

For more information, checkout <http://citycampmn.org/>. Session ideas come
entirely from participants. To submit a session idea, visit
<http://citycampmn2013.ideascale.com/>.

And join us at DevJam Studios the following day, Sunday the 10th, for a civic
hackathon based on the ideas and discussions of CityCampMN!
