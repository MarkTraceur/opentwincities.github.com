National Day of Civic Hacking is a national event that will take place on the
weekend of June 1-2, 2013, in over forty cities across the nation. The event
will bring together citizens to collaboratively create, build, and invent new
technology solutions using publicly-released data to solve challenges relevant
to our neighborhoods, our cities, our states, and our country. National Day of
Civic Hacking will provide citizens an opportunity to do what is most
quintessentially American: roll up our sleeves, get involved, and work together
to improve our society.

Our event in the Twin Cities will be hosted by DevJam in Minneapolis, who has
graciously offered to lend us their space for the weekend.

There will be a "hackathon", a "hacking marathon" in which citizens collaborate
to build the best first versions of new or improved civic technology over the
weekend. There will be a contest and prizes for the Best Mobile Apps, Best Web
Sites, and Best New API.

We are also seeking out the most knowledgable technology experts in local, 
state, and federal governments to present examples for how to use public data
APIs (application programming interfaces) in your projects. These useful 
presentations will occur on Saturday.
