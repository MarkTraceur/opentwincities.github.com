    <p>CityCampMN is our region's 2nd installment of the <a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/">wildly popular global unconference series</a> connecting civic doers, makers and hackers together with local and state government officials and civic leaders for a day of learning, discussing, imagining and building.</p>
    <p>Come hack your community. You are the change you've been waiting for. Help create the city you want to live in. </p>
    <p>CityCampMN 2013 is Saturday, November 9th at the TBD location. The event runs from 9 to 4, with a social breakfast at 8am and an exciting White House Champions of Change cocktail celebration with E-Democracy's BeNeighbors.org project afterwards from 4 to 6.</p>
