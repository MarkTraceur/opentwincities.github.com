The City of Minneapolis is moving towards passing an Open Data policy that, 
over time, will change the way the public can access and utilize public data. 
This new policy will impact community-based organizations and their 
constituents, city staff, neighborhoods, social enterprises, and others by 
creating new ways to ask and answer questions and develop better solutions. 
What does this mean for equitable housing goals? How can data support just 
rental housing policy and practices, and when can relying on data to make 
decisions and advocate with renters fall short? Hear from both City and 
community leaders about their work with data and data-driven decision-making in 
Minneapolis neighborhoods.

Following the Housing Forum, you’re invited to join Bill Bushey from Open Twin 
Cities for an intro to open data. What does “open data” mean? What might the 
City of Minneapolis’s new policy mean for community-based organizations and for
technology developers? Share thoughts about what you need to better utilize
open data in your work.

This Housing Forum is co-hosted by CURA (as part of the [CURA:Tech civic technology program](http://www.cura-tech.org/)) 
and [Open Twin Cities](/). Open Twin Cities is a civic tech and design user 
group that meets monthly to share ideas and work on civic projects, and has 
posted a good FAQ about Open Data available [online](/open-data-faq/).
