      <p>Otto Doll, the Chief Information Officer of Minneapolis, has been charged with developing an open data policy for the City. To help develop this policy, Otto is inviting the civic tech community to his office to have a discussion about what that policy should look like. If you have experience with requesting data from Minneapolis or thoughts on how the city should implement open data, please come and help shape this important policy of transparency and innovation.</p>
