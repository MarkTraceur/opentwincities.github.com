Civic tech isn't just about coding and designing. There are a lot of great books and articles out there that address society, culture, technology, discrimination, economics, and all those other things we care about. So lets read and talk about some of them. 

What is the relationship between computer code and the legal code? For much of 
the 90s and 00s, the Internet appeared to be unregulatable, and many argued 
that computing and network technologies have innate global, democratic 
qualities that have no need or ability to be ruled by a government (a 
sentiment [famously expressed by John Perry Barlow](https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html) 
of the Electronic Frontier Foundation). Yet, the last decade seems to have 
proven the opposite argument - the Internet is a powerful technology that 
significantly impacts the lives and actions of individuals, but it has no 
innate moral values and no special qualities that prevent it from being 
regulated and used by traditional nation states. 

Lawrence Lessig is among the foremost proponents for the latter argument, with 
Lessig making his detailed arguments though his books *Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace* 
and *Code: Version 2*.  Since its publication in 2006, *Code: Version 2* has 
become foundational reading for anybody who wishes to understand the impact of 
Internet technology and society or society's impact on the Internet.

In October, let's discuss Lessig's Code: Version 2 (~400 pages), which is available via:
