[The Theater of Public Policy is putting on a show this Monday at 7pm at Bryant Lake Bowl all about government data and civic tech](http://t2p2.net/upcoming-events/2014/4/14/democracy-of-data). And they've invited Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, Minneapolis CIO Otto Doll, and Bill Bushey of Open Twin Cities to come talk about what these things are.

## What's the Theater of Public Policy? 
It's awesomeness. It's a [regular series of interview and improve](http://t2p2.net/upcoming-events); what the StarTribune says CSPAN + SNL would be. Guests are interviewed for ~15 minutes about some issue of public policy, followed by some improve by The Theater based on what was said in that interview. Then it's repeated, this time with a chance for the audience to ask questions.

Tickets are $7 if bought online before Monday, or $10 at the door unless you're a student or have a Fringe button.
