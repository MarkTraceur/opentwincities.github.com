We'll be having our monthly open work meetup at the Humphrey School on August 
26th at 6pm, with guest **Jo Holtan**. Bring yourself, your skills, your 
passion, and your ideas. If you're looking for project ideas, please checkout 
the [Projects Page](/projects).

We'll have a special guest at this meetup: Jo Holtan, creator of (among other 
things) [Penny in Yo' Pants](http://vimeo.com/98808131).
