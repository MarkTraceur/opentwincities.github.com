Visualizing Neighborhoods is a day-long event to bring together neighborhood
leaders, technologists, data visualizers, designers, artists, scientists, civil
servants, and anyexplore how data can be used for research, analyzing, mapping,
outreach, engagement, and communication in our neighborhoods.  The goals are to
start conversations, build community, experiment, and prototype projects for
neighborhoods. 

And for those that may not have the time to be at the event all day, we will be
creating spaces so groups can consult with each other.  Are you a neighborhood
organizer that needs some tips on technologies to help communicate with your
neighborhood better?  Are you a developer that has the coding chops but not
quite sure what problem to solve?  Are you a storyteller, but just not sure
where a good dataset is?
