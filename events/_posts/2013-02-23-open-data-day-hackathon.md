This is an event focused on open data and civic hacking in all sectors
including government and private. This may include writing applications,
identifying data, liberating data, idea building, designing helpful interfaces,
icon making, and more. EVERYONE is welcome! If you don't know how to code, 
that is ok, we'll do our best to help you along.

This event is part of the following two larger events happening around the world:

* [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/)
* [Code Across America](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross)
