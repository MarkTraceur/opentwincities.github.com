## Quick Takeaways

The biggest reason I call CityCampMN 2013 a fantastic success is the energy and
vibe I saw that day. Through out the day I saw people talking EVERYWHERE. In
sessions. In hallways. At lunch. During breakfast. At the reception. There was
never a lull during the unconference; everybody had too much to talk about.

The diversity of participants and discussions also made CityCampMN 2013 a
success. Technologists, community workers, educators, public employees,
artists, and many more could be found at CityCampMN. Sessions covered digital
inclusion; open data; fundraising; open source in governments; citizen
engagement; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) resources;
economic models; visualizing and telling stories with data;  and many, many
more.

Finally, CityCampMN 2013 involved an experiment: what happens when you follow
an unconference with a hackathon? Closing the unconference with an ideation
session for the hackathon brought out significant project ideas, including the
need to tackle Minnesota’s opportunity gap; how to apply gamification to
gather information and promote civic engagement; and how to use mapping to help
parents find a place to live. For the hackathon itself, a lot of people came
riding the wave of enthusiasm from the day before, and worked together on
fantastic projects. Overall, I think closing the unconference with an ideation
exercise for an associated hackathon worked great.
