On April 15th, the [Theater of Public Policy](http://t2p2.net) invited Open 
Twin Cities co-founder Bill Bushey to join Minnesota's Secretary of State Mark
Ritchie and  Minneapolis' CIO Otto Doll on stage for discussion and improve 
about open data in Minnesota.

In case you missed it, the Theater turned April 15th's show into a [podcast
that you can listen to](http://dangerboat.net/podcasts/2014/4/15/democracy-of-data).
The Minnesota Coalition on Government Information also grabbed a [picture and
put up a quick write up](http://www.mncogi.org/open-data-and-comedy-they-can-go-together).
