      <p>Incase you missed it, Eric Roper of the StarTribune wrote a great <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/243124251.html">feature article in the February 2nd issue</a> covering civic tech, open data, the Minneapolis open data direction to staff, and Capitol Code.</p>
      <blockquote>Minneapolis has kept a tight grip on the information it collects even as cities across the country open up streams of public data to developers, journalists and the public. But this past Novemberâ€™s election has spurred calls at City Hall to liberate that data, from food inspections to landlord violations, so it can be analyzed and manipulated for the public good.</blockquote>
