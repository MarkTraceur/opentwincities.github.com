Chicago has one of the biggest, oldest, most productive, and most robust civic technology communities in the country. What makes it tick? What does the Windy City have to teach us? Earlier this month, Steve Clift, Laura Andersen, and myself took a two day civic tech field trip to Chicago, with the goal of sharing and learning as much civic tech as we could.

When people talk about Chicago's civic tech community, what they are usually talking about is a civic tech ecosystem of organizations that span the public, non-profit, and for-profit sectors.
