### Blue Star Landlords ###

- **Problem Statement**: *"How do we transform landlords into touch points for veterans - sources of knowledge and how to obtain them."*

Landlords are a major stakeholder in any housing discussion. Knowing this, the 
team thought about how landlords can be a unique asset in an effort to end 
homelessness - how landlords can be a stable and local in-person source of 
information for veterans seeking housing. At the sametime, the team wondered 
how an initiative might instil hope and a sense of control to homeless veterans.

Blue Star Landlords addresses both of these "how might we?" questions through a 
combination of supportive resources for both landlords and veterans, and a
communications plan that raises awareness of their initiative while highlighting
a community of allies for homeless veterans.

The Blue Star Landlords program would provide training to veterans and 
participating landlords on such issues as the rights and responsibilities of
tenants, the availabity of rent subsidies for veterans, and the availability of
guaranteed rent for veteran tenants. The program would also provide supportive
information materials, including contracting templates, interview questions
for landlords to understand the needs of their veteran tenants, and veteran-centric maps offering locations of nearby county service officers, transit,
food and housing shelters, work force centers, and landlords participating
in the program. Finally, the program would also provide support services to
landlords and tenants, including the already mentioned rent subsidies and 
guarantees, case management support, and complaint mediation.

This is a comprehensive set of resources, but the Blue Star team understood
that it would mean little if nobody knew of their availability. To that end, 
the team created a communications plan that includes direct mailings to landlords,
participation in landlord conferences and events, and participation in Stand 
Down events for new veterans. At the core of this plan is the namesake Blue Star,
a logo for landlords to display to show their participation in the program, and 
a signal to veterans of where to look for supportive landlords and helpful information. 


### Habitat for Vets ###

- **Problem Statement**: *"How might we increase housing resources for homeless vets"*

Veterans share a sense of duty and a desire to do things. This is as true for a
homeless veteran as it is for a veteran who rents or owns a home. The Habitat 
for Vets team took this insight and mixed it with two others: the Twin Cities is 
facing a general shortage in its housing stock, and the Twin Cities contain 
many beautiful but currently uninhabital houses. Considering these together, the
team developed an initiative that would allow volunteers, including veterans,
to work together to rehabilitate a house that veterans can live in.

Logistically, rehab teams would be made up of 15 volunteers that work with 
general contractors and licensed electricians and plumbers. The Habitat for Vets
program would purchases low cost houses, such as houses owned by a city as a result
of unpaid taxes. Depending on the circumstances of the veteran who will live in 
the rehibilitated house, the house will be given to the veteran, opperated as 
a group home for veterans, or turned over to a manager to rent out to  veterans.

All houses rehabilitated through this program would be lived in by veterans,
though it would not require that veterans who eventually live in a house be part
of its rehabilitation. The goal of this program is not to mandate actions. Habitat
for Vets would instead expand the options availabile to veterans - especially 
dishonorably discharged veterans who do not qualify for many veteran aid programs - 
and allow veterans the option to take part in the rehabilitation of their own homes.

### Veterans Serving Veterans ###

- **Problem Statement**: *"How might we establish personal relationships between homeless veterans and other veterans?"*

Homelessness isn't simply an issue of economics. Even more than money, homeless
individuals often need guidance on how to navigate processes, make plans, find
stablility, and cope with emotional hardships. This is all the more true when
veterans return to civilian life, having experienced the trauma of combat, and
finding a society that can be crushingly indifferent.

Considering this need for connection and guidance, the Veterans Serving Veterans
team looked at veteran mentorship options and prototyped an initiative and
website that could connect homeless veterans with veteran mentors.

To get started, the Veterans Serving Veterans team would partner with an 
organization like the St. Stephens Homeless Shelter to pilot a veteran 
mentorship program. Such a program would prefer that mentors be former
military personnel - so that mentors can better understand the experiences of their
mentees and connect with their mentees.

Over the weekend, Veterans Serving Veterans made significant strides in technical
development. Specifically, the team designed a website to support the mentorship
program by helping veterans find mentors, helping mentors and mentees communicate,
and providing resources and structure to mentors to help them connect and advise
their mentee. The team has also begun to answer technical questions, such as 
what platform should be used (Django), and what other services should be 
integrated with the webste (a text message interface via Twilio).
