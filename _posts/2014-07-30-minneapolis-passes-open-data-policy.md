At about noon today, Minneapolis became the 16th city in the United States to enact an open data policy. This policy is both a significant step forward in the accessibility of Minneapolis city government, and a neccessary evolution of the [city's work via innovation, engagement, trust, and collaboration](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/citygoals/index.htm) in the 21st century. It is both the result of a lot of hard work, and the foundation of more work to come from city leaders, city staff, private organizations, and the citizens of Minneapolis.
