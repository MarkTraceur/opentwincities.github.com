At about noon today, Minneapolis became the 16th city in the United States to enact an open data policy. This policy is both a significant step forward in the accessibility of Minneapolis city government, and a neccessary evolution of the [city's work via innovation, engagement, trust, and collaboration](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/citygoals/index.htm) in the 21st century. It is both the result of a lot of hard work, and the foundation of more work to come from city leaders, city staff, private organizations, and the citizens of Minneapolis.

## What the Policy Does

From the policy:

> The purpose of this policy is to set guidelines for incorporating an open data framework into existing and future systems and procedures, and aid in determining what data sets should be made public, how to make the data sets public, and how to maintain the existing published data sets.

More specifically, the policy:

- Requires the creation of a city Open Data Portal within 120 days of passage of the policy (November 27th, 2014) that will host published datasets for download or API access, notify the public of changes to published datasets, make published datasets discoverable by external search engines, and provide a means for public feedback and discussion on open data policies and data set availability;
- Places responsibility on the city's Chief Information Officer (CIO) (or designee) to manage and facilitate this policy;
- Establishes an Open Data Advisory Group welcoming Open Data Coordinators from each city department to coordinate open data activities;
- Requires an annual Open Data Compliance Report prepared by the CIO (or designee) and Open Data Advisory Group;
- Requires that IT contracts awarded after January 1st, 2015 be consistent with and promote this policy - that the city retains ownership and the ability to publish data impacted by awarded contracts;
- Provides a set of guidelines for IT and other city department responsibilities pertaining to open data; and
- Defines a legal disclaimer to accompany datasets made available on the city's open data portal
