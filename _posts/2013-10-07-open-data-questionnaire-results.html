      <p>October 1st has come and gone, as has a bit of time to allow for mail in responses to make it to our mailboxes. Now we are proud to announce the release of candidate responses to the questionnaire.</p>

      <h3>The Questionnaire is Still Open</h3>

      <p>Before getting to the data, we first want to point out that we have decided to keep the questionnaires open through the end of the election. With nearly a month left until election day, we realized there is no good reason not to continue to allow candidates to state their position on the issue of open data. As results come in to the questionnaire, the spreadsheet linked to below will be updated. So be sure to check back between now and the election for any new responses.</p>
