      <h2>Visualizing Neighborhoods: A Hackathon for Good Recap</h2>
      
      <p><a href="http://www.cura.umn.edu/visualizingneighborhoods">Visualizing Neighborhoods: A Hackathon for Good</a> primarily organized by the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA) with help from Open Twin Cities and many others was (and hopefully will continue to be) a hackathon type of event focused on neighborhood or place-based communities and data and other visualizations and took place this year on Saturday, May 25, 2013.</p>

      <blockquote>
        A great group of technologists, neighborhood leaders, designers, analysts, program/project designers and others came for the day and worked on projects ranging from visualizing bus routes in relationship to population density, to imagining a visualization that shows job growth on the Central Corridor... from communication tools to link teachers and parents, to mapping crime in relationship to a variety of environmental factors... from looking at voting patterns between presidential election years, to an activity and route-focused map for connecting youth and adults to urban green space "destinations".  More people dropped by throughout the day, or attended the afternoon Think Tank to learn more about hackathons, data visualizations, and to create pitches.

      <h3>Survey results</h3>
      
      <p>The following are things people said in their survey responses anonymously.</p>
      
      <h4>What we did well</h4>
      
      <blockquote>Lots of undisrupted time to hack--but then the option of participating in some late-afternoon activities for those groups who were winding down by that time. A very good balance of activities and open time.</blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>I thought the entire event was enjoyable. I was nervous to pitch my project, but people were receptive and excited to help out. The fact that everyone was there because they wanted to be meant that most were energetic and willing to share their knowledge and expertise.</blockquote>
      
      
      <h4>What we could improve for next time</h4>
      
      <blockquote>Time management for teams. 5 hours is a really short window of time.</blockquote>
      
      
      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
      
      <blockquote>There is a huge need for these kinds of community org/tech community collaborations, and I was amazed by the breadth and depth of the project ideas. Keep this up--I'd definitely attend more of these in the future!</blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>I think the most important thing I took away was that there are many people willing to help out our nonprofit's cause. Several team members have indicated their desire to help advance the project moving forward.</blockquote>
