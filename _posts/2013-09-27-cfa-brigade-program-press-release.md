**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Open Twin Cities Officially Named a Code for America Brigade </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Open Twin Cities officially joins a national
network of 30+ community groups collaborating with local governments to use
technology to solve problems</em></p>

**Minneapolis, MN, September 27, 2013** — Open Twin Cities, a local group of
citizen technologists and public servants working to develop inclusive
solutions to open government, has been working with Code for America since the
group’s inception late last year to bring national best practices to the local level.

Last week, Code for America released the 
[2013 Captain’s Brigade](http://www.codeforamerica.org/2013/09/17/brigade-captains/)
making the relationship official.

Code for America (CfA) launched the Brigade program in 2012 with 16 local
chapters; and last week announced the addition of 15 new Brigades, supported
by 28 new Captains.

Open Twin Cities co-founders Alan Palazzo (MinnPost) and Bill Bushey
(E-Democracy.org) will serve as the official CfA co-captains and participate in
the Brigade’s leadership program, which includes monthly trainings,
participation in a network of civic and tech leaders, and support from Code for
America staff.

> “We are excited to build on our relationship with Code for America, to learn
> from the experiences of other Code for America Brigades, and to share our
> growing civic hacking community with the nation.”
