Chicago has one of the biggest, oldest, most productive, and most robust civic 
technology communities in the country. What makes it tick? What does the Windy 
City have to teach the Twin Cities? Earlier this month, Steve Clift, Laura 
Andersen, and myself took a two day civic tech field trip to Chicago, with the 
goal of sharing and learning as much civic tech as we could. The following is 
the first in a series of posts on what we learned during this trip, and what it
made us think about.

## What They've Built

So what can such a healthy and mature civic technology community do? Well, in 
the brief 36 hours we were in Chicago, we talked about a lot of projects, 
covering tech infrastructure, citizen oversight tools, and issue advocacy 
tools, including:

- [Chicago's City Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) with over 1000 datasets
- [Cook County's Data Portal](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/) with over 350 datasets
- [Chicago's Data Dictionary](http://datadictionary.cityofchicago.org/), which catelogs and describes the data (published and not) that City of Chicago agencies have
- [Connect Chicago](http://weconnectchicago.org/) - A database of locations in Chicago that provide publicly accessible computers
- [Chicago Works for You](http://chicagoworksforyou.com/) - A daily ward by ward reports on the city's delivery of services
- [Chicago Lobbiests](http://chicagolobbyists.org/) - Information on the activities, clients, and financing of lobbiests in the City of Chicago
- [School Cuts](http://www.schoolcuts.org/) - An interactive website about Chicago's decision to close over 100 schools, including criteria for these decisions, statuses of all involved schools, and metrics of all involved schools
- [TIF Illumination Project](http://www.tifreports.com/) - A description of Chicago's Tax Increment Financing (TIF) program, changes in the program, and the economic impact the TIF program is having on communities in Chicago

These projects are just a sampling of what Chicago's civic tech community has 
built and is continuing to build. It might not be possible to list every civic 
tech project that has come out of Chicago, but if you want to see more Chicago 
projects, checkout [Open City's projects page](http://opencityapps.org/#projects), 
[Smart Chicago's projects page](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/projects/), 
and the [projects page of the Data Science for Social Good program](http://dssg.io/projects/).

For me, the most impressive thing to be built in Chicago is the community of
individuals who now engage with civic institutions around technology. Chicago's
weekly [Open Gov Hack Nights](http://opengovhacknight.org/) regularly draw 75+ 
members - as many participants as a Twin Cities civic hackathon. Chicago civic 
hackers attract Chicago civic servants; City employees attend the Open Gov Hack
Nights to share job postings, new city projects, and presentations on city 
initiatives and technologies. This community is even cultivating sub-
communities! Chicago hackers are building communities around issues, offering a
new public forum in which to learn, discuss, and take action on the core civic
issues such as education and climate.

A count of apps and websites is often thrown around as the metric of success of
civic tech. I'll contend that this measure overlooks civic tech's true 
potential - to be a new avenue for passionate civic engagement. This is what 
Chicago has built.
