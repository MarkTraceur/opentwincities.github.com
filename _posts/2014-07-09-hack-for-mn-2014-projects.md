## Open Hack Projects ##


### Airstatus ### 

- Contact: Richard Barnes
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969465)
- Awarded: Meeting with Otto Doll, CIO of the City of Minneapolis
- [GitHub](https://github.com/r-barnes/airquality)
- [Demo](http://airstatus.info/)
- SMS Number: 443-201-AIRQ (text zipcode for air status in your area)

Aiming to create a single API of air quality information based on many different
data sources across the U.S. and the world, to make it easy for designers and 
developers to include air quality information in their apps and sites. By the 
end of Hack for MN, the API could provide information from approximately 3000
stations across North America, and the team was working on pulling in 
air quality information from the U.K. and Germany.

The team also created a demo web and text application to map, visualize, and 
retrieve air quality information based on the Airstatus API. Besides 
demonstrating how to use of the API, this application also provides an 
environment for the team to experiment with ways of displaying highly technical
information to the general public.


### PLANIT ###

- Contact:
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969467)
- Awarded: Meeting with DeAnna Cummings, Executive Director of Juxtaposition Arts
- [Minneapolis Park Boundaries Dataset](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/Metro-Parks-in-Minneapolis/hnpv-xa5t)

This project, which was first pitched at the [CityCampMN 2013 hackathon](/events/2013/11/09/citycampmn/), 
started with the task of creating a single place for residents to be able to view and 
plan informal activities at city parks, like pickup basketball games. The team 
was also motivated by the questions of how to engage youth in nearby activities, 
and how to help individuals meet people at parks. 

"It's like a Yelp for activities"

The bulk of team PLANIT's work during Hack for MN involved creating a dataset 
and map of  Minneapolis parks that includes information on activities and 
services provided at parks, based on combining data from the City of 
Minneapolis and Hennepin County.

With that accomplished, the team now wants to build a way for individuals and
residents to be able to submit their own activities, and for folks to be able
to use this platform via text messaging.


### The API Store ###

- Contact: [David Ching](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=159829397)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969464)
- Awarded: Meeting with Carolyn Parnell, CIO of the State of Minnesota
- [Post of History](/2014/06/13/capitol-code-update-government-api-store/)

Continuing their work from [Capitol Code/CodeAcross 2014](/2014/02/27/capitol-code-projects/), 
the API Store team has been tackling the business, policy, and political issues
that come about when a government decides to make its data openly available as
downloadable datasets or APIs. Having established the framework of open data 
publishers and subscribers, the API Store team has begun to identify the 
expectations and responsibilities of these two groups, and the characteristics of
the relationship between these two groups.

The API Store team has examined two important features that a government open
data portal should have: a catalog of all open data provided by that government; 
and analytics on the use of published data for the benefit of both publishers 
(to understand what datasets are popular and the sources of extreme demand) and
users (to better understand performance issues of applications that use open 
data).


### Voter Guide ###

- Contact: [Steve Clift](https://twitter.com/democracy) and [Tim Erikson](https://twitter.com/stpaultim) 
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969463)
- Awarded: Agile consulting session with Dion Stewart, Agile Coach at DevJam Studios
- [Project Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x2NYYG3_rUPLK_VujVXORndnFUXLiVs_DJZZbcgmqNE/edit) - Includes links to crowdsourced MN House Candidate social media accounts
- [Demo](http://dev-voter-guide.gotpantheon.com/)

Building upon the crowd-sourcing and visualization work of a [Capitol Code 2014 project(/2014/02/27/capitol-code-projects/),
the Voter Guide team began by seeking to expand the collected social media 
accounts of Minnesota politicians to include 2014 candidates for office.
Once they expanded their scope to candidates, the team decided they could also
expand their scope to create a full guide for voters on all of the candidates
that are running in their district(s), beginning with a site that makes it easy
for voters to find the social media accounts of their candidates.

With a Drupal site running that does just that, the team is now looking at what
other information would be useful to include for voters, including official information (such as campaign contributions). The team is also planning on
creating an API so other sites and developers can easily incorporate this
important information.


### Homescreen for the Homeless ###

- Contact: [Colin Lee](https://twitter.com/colinmlee)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969462)
- Awarded: Service Design consultation with Laura Andersen, Owner of Praidea
- [GitHub](https://github.com/colintheshots/HomelessHomeScreen)
- [Play Store Page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=colintheshots.homelesshomescreen)

Based on the observation that smartphones are becoming more prevalent among
homeless populations, and that basic information about resources available for
the homeless can be very hard to find, this team created an Android app to 
provide a single listing of social services and homeless assistance programs.

Homescreen for the Homeless organizes and lists phone numbers, URLs, and apps
that can connect homeless populations with various resources, such as 
job search apps and shelters. These resources are organized based on focus or
situation, and intelligently integrate with the smartphone to form appropriate
actions, such as dialing a phone number or opening an installed app. 

With a prototype of the Android app built, the team is now looking at the
problem of gathering lists of homelessness and social service resources. To
that end, the team is planning to crowd-source phone numbers, URLs, and apps
that can connect homeless individuals with resources they want or need.


### PyLadies Web Scrapping ###

- Contact: [Dana Engebretson](https://twitter.com/DanaKE/)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98964771)
- Awarded: Meeting with Nancy Lyons, President & CEO of Clockwork Active Media

By combining data from the Meetup API with the power of Python web scrapping, 
the new [PyLadies Twin Cities](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTC/) group wanted
to track, analyze, and visualize the representation of women in Twin Cities
technology meetups. And ultimately, they want more women to be part of the Twin
Cities' technology community.

To begin with, the PyLadies have established a set of metrics to use when 
analyzing the populations, attendees, and speakers of Twin Cities technology
groups. The team also spent the weekend learning how to scrape webpages using
Python and Beautiful Soup.

Going forward, the team will present its first analysis of a technology group
at the July Twin Cities PyMNTos meetup. The team also plans to analyze other
Twin Cities technology groups, and to apply text analysis to understand how men
and women describe themselves in Twin Cities technology groups.

## Heading Home Challenge Teams ##

### Blue Star Landlords ###

- [Video](http://youtu.be/z3QebOq4blQ?t=1h3m23s)

"How do we transform landlords into touch points for veterans - sources of knowledge and how to uptain them."

Make homeless veterans feel more hopeful and in control of their lives
Transform landlords into stable, local, face to face resouces for information.


Direct mailing to landlords to participate, and advistising at landlord events
Stand Down Participantion:
  * Landlord information booth
  * Veterans housing rights/benefits booths
Brochures for landlords to handout to venterans about healthcare, financial aid, transit
Phone operators for landlords
Use a bluestar logo on buildings to indetify housing providers that participate in the program


Training for landlords provided:

 * Availability of guarenteed rent for housed veterans
 * Availability of rent subsidies for veterans
 * Training for veterans to be tenants (communicating with landlord and other tenants)

Case management support
Complaint triage
Contracting templates and Interview questions between landlord and potential tenants


Veteran centric map/GIS resource, available in print
  Include county service officer locations, transit, sympathetic housing locations, food and temporary housing shelters, work force centers


### Habitat for Vets ###

- [Video](http://youtu.be/z3QebOq4blQ?t=1h10m35s)

"How might we increase housing resources for homeless vets"

Veterans and volunteers work together to rehab a house that a veteran will live in when it is finished.

Emails with volunteer signup forms to forward amongst friends/networks

Work with general contractors to provide work oversight
Teams of 15 work on houses

Take a vacant house (which would be cheap to purchase), remodel it via the veteran/volunteer team, and give it to a veteran
Thinking of vets who have been dishonorably discharged, who do not qualify for many other veteran programs

Potential options:

* Group houses
* Remodel rental units on the condition that the unit must go to a homeless veteran

Understand that individuals want to be part of their own solution, want to feel like they've earned their house
A veteran receiving housing in this program would not have to be part of the rehab team. The option is available for individuals who want to be part of rehabing a house.
Veteran would likely work on the unskilled portions of rehabbing (not electrical or plumbing)

On going costs for the house would be property taxes and maintenance - which leads to the group house idea and rental remodeling


### Veterans Serving Veterans ###

- [Video](http://youtu.be/z3QebOq4blQ?t=1h21m53s)

"How might we establish personal relationships between homeless veterans and other veterans?"

Website to connect mentors and mentees and provide structure for veterans who are struggling
Website can also help mentors and mentees communicate
Mentors would have to be former military personnel (at least initially; later might branch out to other people in communities that serve veterans and the homeless)

St. Stevens Homeless Shelter would be a pilot location

Already started desiging the website - planning to use Django, Bootstrap, and considering using Twilio to allow mentors and mentees to communicate without sharing personal numbers if perfer not to

Initial plan is to partner with an established organization that has homeless and/or veteran programming. The organization would create a mentorship program between veterans and homeless veterans.

Understand that homeless veterans may not have consistent access to communications. Also understand that homeless population includes a small number of homeless on the street and a larger portion of individuals who move between places to stay

Mentee Interface:
Application would be simple for mentees, only listing a couple of potential actions in order to lower the barrier to taking an action (especially reaching out to a mentor)
Mentee can provide information on where they will be and their time availability
Potential Idea: can display other resources available to the veteran

Mentor Interface:
A bit more sophisticated
Includes projects/ideas to do to help the mentee
