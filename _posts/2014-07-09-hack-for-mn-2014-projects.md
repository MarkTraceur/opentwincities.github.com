## Open Hack Projects ##

### Airstatus ### 

- Contact: Richard Barnes
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969465)
- Awarded: Meeting with Otto Doll, CIO of the City of Minneapolis
- [GitHub](https://github.com/r-barnes/airquality)
- [Demo](http://airstatus.info/)
- SMS Number: 443-201-AIRQ (text zipcode for air status in your area)

Aiming to create a single API of air quality information based on many different
data sources across the U.S. and the world, to make it easy for designers and 
developers to include air quality information in their apps and sites. By the 
end of Hack for MN, the API could provide information from approximately 3000
stations across North America, and the team was working on pulling in 
air quality information from the U.K. and Germany.

The team also created a demo web and text application to map, visualize, and 
retrieve air quality information based on the Airstatus API. Besides 
demonstrating how to use of the API, this application also provides an 
enviornment for the team to experiment with ways of displaying highly technical
information to the general public.


### PLANIT ###

- Contact:
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969467)
- Awarded: Meeting with DeAnna Cummings, Executive Director of Juxtaposition Arts
- [Minneapolis Park Boundaries Dataset](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/Metro-Parks-in-Minneapolis/hnpv-xa5t)

This project, which was first pitched at the [CityCampMN 2013 hackathon](/events/2013/11/09/citycampmn/), 
started with the task of creating a single place for residents to be able to view and 
plan informal activities at city parks, like pickup basketball games. The team 
was also motivated by the questions of how to engage youth in nearby activities, 
and how to help individuals meet people at parks. 

"It's like a Yelp for activities"

The bulk of team PLANIT's work during Hack for MN involved creating a dataset 
and map of  Minneapolis parks that includes information on activities and 
services provided at parks, based on combining data from the City of 
Minneapolis and Hennepin County.

With that accomplised, the team now wants to build a way for individuals and
residents to be able to submit their own activities, and for folks to be able
to use this platform via text messaging.


### The API Store ###

- Contact: [David Ching](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=159829397)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969464)
- Awarded: Meeting with Carolyn Parnell, CIO of the State of Minnesota

Continuing their work from [Capitol Code/CodeAcross 2014](/2014/02/27/capitol-code-projects/), 
the API Store team has been tackeling the business, policy, and political issues
that come about when a government decides to make its data openly available as
downloadable datasets or APIs. Having established the framework of open data 
publishers and subscribers, the API Store team has begun to identify the 
expectations and responsibilities of these two groups, and the characterists of
the relationship between these two groups.

The API Store team has examined two important features that a government open
data portal should have: a catelog of all open data provided by that government; 
and analytics on the use of published data for the benefit of both publishers 
(to understand what datasets are popular and the sources of extreme demand) and
users (to better understand performance issues of applications that use open 
data).


### Voter Guide ###

* [Demo](http://dev-voter-guide.gotpantheon.com/)

Listings and profiles of state and local candidates for office in 2014, including social media accounts - * Home Screen for the Homeless - Android app to set the home screen of the phone to a list of urls/phone numbers/apps of local social service and homelessness organizations

### PyLadies Web Scrapping ###

Scrapping, tracking, and visualizing demographics of technology meetups/user groups, with the purpose of increasing the number of women participating in these groups.
