- SMS Number: 443-201-AIRQ (text zipcode for air status in your area)

Aiming to create a single API of air quality information based on many different
data sources across the U.S. and the world, to make it easy for designers and 
developers to include air quality information in their apps and sites. By the 
end of Hack for MN, the API could provide information from approximately 3000
stations across North America, and the team was working on pulling in 
air quality information from the U.K. and Germany.

The team also created a demo web and text application to map, visualize, and 
retrieve air quality information based on the Airstatus API. Besides 
demonstrating how to use of the API, this application also provides an 
enviornment for the team to experiment with ways of displaying highly technical
information to the general public.
