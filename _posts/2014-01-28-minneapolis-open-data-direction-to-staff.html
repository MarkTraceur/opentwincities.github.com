      <p>Well I'm ashamed to admit this, but we were totally unaware that one of the final acts of the 2012 Minneapolis City Council was to issue a Direction to Staff on opening up city data. The below Direction is quoted from the <a href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/meetings/proceedings/WCMS1P-118373">December 11th, 2013 Official Proceedings of the Minneapolis City Council</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Direct all City departments to make data available online using open standards;
      further direct that the Information Technology Director convene a working group to include the
      City Coordinator and key department staff, with feedback from the Information Technology
      Executive Group, to develop a policy and implementation schedule for the “Open Data
      Directive,” and report on progress to the Ways & Means Committee and Information Technology
      Policy committee starting in March 2014 and at regular intervals thereafter.</blockquote>
