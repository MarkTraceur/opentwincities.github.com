USA Today just posted a [nice article](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/05/stateline-states-open-data-money/10006405/) about the growth of open data around the country, the great things happening at hackathons, and the ways in which governments are supporting and benefiting from both.

And at the very top of the article is a photo taken from an Open Twin Cities meetup.
