      <p>With contested Minneapolis Mayoral and City Council races coming this November, momentum is growing within the Open Twin Cities community to advocate for open data in Minneapolis. To help with our advocacy efforts, we are gathering the following list of policy resources from around the world. Our goals is for this list to include examples and comparisons of existing open data policies, analyses of open data, arguments for and against open data, and experiences from those who have advocated for open data.</p>
      <p>Note that most of these are collections of links and references. There is a lot of information available below.</p>
