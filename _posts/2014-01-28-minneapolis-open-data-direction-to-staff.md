Well I'm ashamed to admit this, but we were totally unaware that one of the
final acts of the 2012 Minneapolis City Council was to issue a Direction to
Staff on opening up city data. The below Direction is quoted from the 
[December 11th, 2013 Official Proceedings of the Minneapolis City Council](http://www.minneapolismn.gov/meetings/proceedings/WCMS1P-118373).

> Direct all City departments to make data available online using open
> standards; further direct that the Information Technology Director convene a
> working group to include the City Coordinator and key department staff, with
> feedback from the Information Technology Executive Group, to develop a policy
> and implementation schedule for the “Open Data Directive,” and report on
> progress to the Ways & Means Committee and Information Technology Policy
> committee starting in March 2014 and at regular intervals thereafter.
