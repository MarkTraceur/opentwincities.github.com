Chicago has one of the biggest, oldest, most productive, and most robust civic technology communities in the country. What makes it tick? What does the Windy City have to teach us? Earlier this month, Steve Clift, Laura Andersen, and myself took a two day civic tech field trip to Chicago, with the goal of sharing and learning as much civic tech as we could.

## What They've Built

So what can such a healthy and mature civic technology community do? Well, in the brief 36 hours we were in Chicago, we talked about a lot of projects, including:

- [Chicago's City Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) with over 1000 datasets
- [Cook County's Data Portal](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/) with over 350 datasets
- [Chicago's Data Dictionary](http://datadictionary.cityofchicago.org/), which catelogs and describes the data (published and not) that City of Chicago agencies have
- [Connect Chicago](http://weconnectchicago.org/) - A database of locations in Chicago that provide publicly accessible computers
- [Chicago Works for You](http://chicagoworksforyou.com/) - Daily ward by ward reports on the city's delivery of services
- [Chicago Lobbiests](http://chicagolobbyists.org/) - Information on the activities, clients, and financing of lobbiests in the City of Chicago
- [School Cuts](http://www.schoolcuts.org/) - Interactive website about Chicago's decision to close over 100+, including criteria for these decisions, statuses of all involved schools, and metrics of all involved schools
- [TIF Illumination Project](http://www.tifreports.com/) - Description of Chicago's Tax Increment Financing (TIF) program, changes in the program, and the economic impact the TIF program is having on communities in Chicago

These projects, which cover tech infrastructure, citizen oversight tools, and issue advocacy tools, is just a sample of what Chicago's civic tech community has built and is continuing to build. It might not be possible to list every civic tech project that has come out of Chicago, but if you want to see more Chicago projects, checkout [Open City's projects page](http://opencityapps.org/#projects), [Smart Chicago's projects page](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/projects/), and the [projects page of the Data Science for Social Good program](http://dssg.io/projects/).

- [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship](http://dssg.io/) - A summer long fellowship program that invites college and graduate students to create visualization and analysis applications for community projects all across the country
