With contested Minneapolis Mayoral and City Council races coming this November,
momentum is growing within the Open Twin Cities community to advocate for open
data in Minneapolis. To help with our advocacy efforts, we are gathering the
following list of policy resources from around the world. Our goals is for this
list to include examples and comparisons of existing open data policies,
analyses of open data, arguments for and against open data, and experiences
from those who have advocated for open data.

Note that most of these are collections of links and references. There is a lot
of information available below.
