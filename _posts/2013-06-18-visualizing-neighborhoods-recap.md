[Visualizing Neighborhoods: A Hackathon for Good](http://www.cura.umn.edu/visualizingneighborhoods)
primarily organized by the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA) with
help from Open Twin Cities and many others was (and hopefully will continue to
be) a hackathon type of event focused on neighborhood or place-based
communities and data and other visualizations and took place this year on
Saturday, May 25, 2013.

> A great group of technologists, neighborhood leaders, designers, analysts,
> program/project designers and others came for the day and worked on projects
> ranging from visualizing bus routes in relationship to population density, to
> imagining a visualization that shows job growth on the Central Corridor...
> from communication tools to link teachers and parents, to mapping crime in
> relationship to a variety of environmental factors... from looking at voting
> patterns between presidential election years, to an activity and
> route-focused map for connecting youth and adults to urban green space
> "destinations".  More people dropped by throughout the day, or attended the
> afternoon Think Tank to learn more about hackathons, data visualizations, and
> to create pitches.

## Survey results
      
The following are things people said in their survey responses anonymously.
      
### What we did well
      
> Lots of undisrupted time to hack--but then the option of participating in
> some late-afternoon activities for those groups who were winding down by that
> time. A very good balance of activities and open time.
      
> I thought the entire event was enjoyable. I was nervous to pitch my project,
> but people were receptive and excited to help out. The fact that everyone was
> there because they wanted to be meant that most were energetic and willing to
> share their knowledge and expertise.

### What we could improve for next time

> Time management for teams. 5 hours is a really short window of time.

### Takeaways

> There is a huge need for these kinds of community org/tech community
> collaborations, and I was amazed by the breadth and depth of the project
> ideas. Keep this up--I'd definitely attend more of these in the future!

> I think the most important thing I took away was that there are many people
> willing to help out our nonprofit's cause. Several team members have
> indicated their desire to help advance the project moving forward.

## Projects

We did not do the best of job of capturing information on all the great
activities, as this is difficult, but here is the information that we have so
far.  Feel free to [update this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5BqpuYyPYFEaFUasunVxaCQIqVxjq1RKlWQhT2cBRQ/edit)
if you attended and the things you worked on are not represented here.
      
### Bus Routes (#8 Minneapolis)

- **Team**: Peter Fleck, Dave Kaminski, David Middlecamp, Wade Stebbings
- **Code**: <https://github.com/dmiddlecamp/Route8>

Using data to find out how many people are served by individual bus stops;
evaluate current service and place for the future.  Notes including explanation
of GitHub files: <http://goo.gl/zjaGr>

### Green Spaces (mapping and gaming) / Bike Destinations
        
- **Team**: ??
- **Website**: <http://websites.greeninfo.org/vizhoods/>

Project Get Outdoors wants to create a check-in style game for outdoor
spaces/activities for kids / Route planning, locating amenities surrounding
routes, alerts for activities, etc.  Discussed user experience and
possibilities for app interface from multiple perspectives (kids, parents,
adults, and naturalists).  Drew inspiration from a Sherlock Holmes story map
via alistapart.com.  Produced a custom styled map via Mapbox.com and swapped
the Sherlock Holmes story and locations with information for a Walking Tour of
Mill City at <http://websites.greeninfo.org/vizhoods/>.

## Other projects that were pitched

- **Equity Assessment Atlas**: Met Council produced a study; opportunity to
  make info public and ongoing, and use the data created.

  poverty with education and training, especially by reaching families with
  youth ages 9-14 years and connecting them to resources, training and jobs.
- **Be able to see where students are living and going to school**: Including
  charter and public schools.
- **Health and information for patients**: Patients controlling e-health
  records.  Patients and clinics sharing and combining data for doctors.
  Visualizing complexities of procedures and variables.
