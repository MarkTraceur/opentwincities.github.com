### Open Twin Cities Socrata Community Data Portal

<https://communities.socrata.com/catalog/open-twin-cities/>

Socrata has graciously provided Open Twin Cities with a Community data portal
to host datasets that we have received or requested from local governments. The
datasets found on this portal can be downloaded in a number of formats,
investigated in browser, and many are also available in a APIs hosted on the
platfrom.

### Minnesota Data Collection Spreadsheet

[Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtkFCdxQ11AOdGpWWnpuVzdaNG1SVG40MXlyZ0hSVEE#gid=13)

An advanced Google spreadsheet collecting and cataloging 1000's of datasets
available for Minnesota. Including a single place to search for links to
datasets included on MetroGIS, MNGeo, MN DNR, and more. This was created by a
team participating in the 
[Open Twin Cities 2013 Open Data Day/CodeAcross Hackathon](/events/2013/02/23/open-data-day-hackathon/)

### Capitol Code Data Page

<http://capitolcode.mn.gov/data/>

A page created for [Capitol Code: An Open Data Jam](/events/2014/02/22/capitol-code/)
- Minnesota's 2014 Open Data Day/CodeAcross event. This page lists the datasets
featured that day, with links to available downloads and API endpoints, and
brief descriptions of the dataset. Includes a Table of Contents for easier
browsing. Datasets from the following organizations are listed:

* Secretary of State
* Minnesota Geospatial Information Office
* Department of Agriculture
* Department of Natural Resources
* Pollution Control Agency

### Hennepin County GIS Data Portal

<http://www.hennepin.us/your-government/open-government/gis-open-data>

Following [Hennepin County's resolution to allow open access to the county's
GIS data](/2014/02/12/ramsey-and-hennepin-pass-opengis/), the County created
a GIS data portal. Currently, this portal includes GIS data on taxable parcels,
address points, the boundaries of the county, street centerlines, alternate
names for streets, municipal boundaries, aerial imagery, commissioner 
districts, and topography.

It should be noted that while Hennepin County is sharing data on this portal
free of license and charge, there are [concerns that the format in which the
data are provided does not lend itself to free and accessible use](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/twin-cities-brigade/kAip-krnO8g/Yht9GvUq3JMJ).
These data are provided in the same format that Hennepin County stores and uses
these data. The community is currently working on a solution for the problem of
how to convert these data into a more reusable format, and potentially how to
host these converted datasets.
