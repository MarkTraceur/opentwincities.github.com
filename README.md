# opentwincities.github.com

Main website for the Open Twin Cities group

## About

This site is designed to run on Github (through [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/))
with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Run locally

1. ```gem install jekyll redcarpet```
1. ```jekyll server --watch```
1. Go to ```http://localhost:4000``` in your web browser.

GitHub runs the close-to-newest release of Jekyll, so be sure to `gem update jekyll` periodically.

This should watch for changes, so there is no need to restart server
while working on this.  Also, for reference see the [Jekyll install instructions](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install).

## Editing content

The idea of Jekyll is that it compiles things into static HTML, so most of the content
is handled with basic HTML or Markdown in flat files in the repository.

If you just want to update content, consider using [prose.io](http://prose.io/), as
it is a nice web based interface for editing text files on Github.
